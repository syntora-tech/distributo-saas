## Task Status Rules
- `TODO` - Task is not started
- `IN_PROGRESS` - Task is currently being worked on
- `REVIEW` - Task is completed and needs review
- `DONE` - Task is completed and approved
- `BLOCKED` - Task is blocked by dependencies or issues

## Priority Levels
- `P0` - Critical, must be done first
- `P1` - High priority, should be done in first iteration
- `P2` - Medium priority, can be done in second iteration
- `P3` - Low priority, can be done in third iteration

## Task Management Rules
1. Each task must be in a separate file
2. After each interaction with a task, update its status
3. Update this README.md with current task statuses
4. Commit changes before starting a new task
5. Commit changes after completing a task
6. Each task should be small but cover a specific scope
7. Each task file must contain:
   - Detailed description
   - Requirements
   - Current status
   - Dependencies (if any)
8. When task is completed:
   - Update task status to DONE
   - Create commit with message "feat: [task-name] - [short description]"
   - No need to ask for commit message, just do it
